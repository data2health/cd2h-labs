# cd2h-labs
Demonstration web sit for the Center for Data to Health and its collaborators

Please post working URLs for wrapping/display in this ticket: https://github.com/data2health/cd2h-labs/issues/3
There is an expectation that any CD2H funded software development projects that have advanced to having working code should be available for testing in CD2H labs. We would like to have all of these made available before the iDTF meeting. 

Please feel free to make tickets: Anything involving look and feel for the overall Labs site, and anything involving hooking external elements into the framework goes here.  Anything involving project management dashboard appearance and functionality goes in https://github.com/data2health/cd2h-analytics.
